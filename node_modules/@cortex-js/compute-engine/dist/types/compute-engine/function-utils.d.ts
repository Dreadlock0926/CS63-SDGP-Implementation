/***
 * ## THEORY OF OPERATIONS
 *
 * A `["Function"]` expression has its own scope.
 * This scope includes the parameters and local variables.
 *
 * Some expressions with anonymous parameters (e.g. `["Add", "_", 1]`)
 * are rewritten to a `["Function"]` expression with anonymous parameters
 * (e.g. `["Function", ["Add", "_", 1], "_"]`).
 *
 * The **body** of a `["Function"]` expression may have its own scope
 * (for example if it's a `["Block"]` expression) or may not have a scope
 * at all (if it's a number, i.e. `["Function", 1]`). the function body may
 * be a number, a symbol or (more commonly) an function expression.
 *
 *
 * ### DURING BOXING (in makeLambda())
 *
 * During the boxing/canonicalization phase of a function
 * (`["Function"]` expression or head expression):
 *
 * 1/ If not a `["Function"]` expression, the expression is rewritten
 *    to a `["Function"]` expression with anonymous parameters
 * 2/ A new scope is created
 * 3/ The function parameters are declared in the scope
 * 4/ The function body is boxed in the context of the scope and the scope
 *    is associated with the function
 *
 *
 * ### DURING EVALUATION (executing the result of makeLambda())
 *
 * 1/ The arguments are evaluated in the current scope
 * 2/ The context is swapped to the function scope
 * 3/ The values of all the ids in this scope are reset
 * 4/ The parameters are set to the value of the arguments
 * 5/ The function body is evaluated in the context of the function scope
 * 6/ The context is swapped back to the current scope
 * 7/ The result of the function body is returned
 *
