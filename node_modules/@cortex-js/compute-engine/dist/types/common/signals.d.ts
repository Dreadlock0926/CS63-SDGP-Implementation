 * The error codes can be used in an `ErrorCode` expression:
 *
 *        `["ErrorCode", "'syntax-error'", arg1]`
 *
 * It evaluates to a localized, human-readable string.
 *
 *
 * * `unknown-symbol`: a symbol was encountered which does not have a
 * definition.
 *
 * * `unknown-operator`: a presumed operator was encountered which does not
 * have a definition.
 *
 * * `unknown-function`: a LaTeX command was encountered which does not
 * have a definition.
 *
 * * `unexpected-command`: a LaTeX command was encountered when only a string
 * was expected
 *
 * * `unexpected-superscript`: a superscript was encountered in an unexpected
 * context, or no `powerFunction` was defined. By default, superscript can
 * be applied to numbers, symbols or expressions, but not to operators (e.g.
 * `2+^34`) or to punctuation.
 *
 * * `unexpected-subscript`: a subscript was encountered in an unexpected
 * context or no 'subscriptFunction` was defined. By default, subscripts
 * are not expected on numbers, operators or symbols. Some commands (e.g. `\sum`)
 * do expected a subscript.
 *
 * * `unexpected-sequence`: some adjacent elements were encountered (for
 * example `xy`), but the elements could not be combined. By default, adjacent
 * symbols are combined with `Multiply`, but adjacent numbers or adjacent
 * operators are not combined.
 *
 * * `expected-argument`: a LaTeX command that requires one or more argument
 * was encountered without the required arguments.
 *
 * * `expected-operand`: an operator was encountered without its required
 * operands.
 *
 * * `non-associative-operator`: an operator which is not associative was
 * encountered in an associative context, for example: `a < b < c` (assuming
 * `<` is defined as non-associative)
 *
 * * `postfix-operator-requires-one-operand`: a postfix operator which requires
 * a single argument was encountered with no arguments or more than one argument
 *
 * * `prefix-operator-requires-one-operand`: a prefix operator which requires
 * a single argument was encountered with no arguments or more than one argument
 *
 * * `base-out-of-range`:  The base is expected to be between 2 and 36.
